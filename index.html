    <p>
      With you, I felt things I once thought I couldn’t feel anymore. I cared deeper, loved fuller not too much, not too little, just enough to remind me that life still holds something beautiful. You gave color to days that used to feel dull, turned my blues and greys into something softer maybe even a little pink. I never liked pink before but somehow, with you, it feels warmer. Brighter. Lighter. Watching you exist, just being you, makes everything seem more alive. You carry a certain light within you. Even from afar, I would always recognize it. There’s something about you so gentle, so tender, so full of quiet wonder and I truly hope you never lose that softness.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m not the most faithful believer in fate or destiny, but today I’ll make a wish anyway. I wish that you always keep the gentleness a tired soul longs for. I wish that happiness finds you easily and stays. And even on days when it doesn’t, I hope you always have the strength to keep going just like you unknowingly gave strength to me.
      <br><br>
      Sincerely yours,<br>
      Hutton.
